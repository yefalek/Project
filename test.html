  <h3 class="poem-title">Fly, Dragonfly!</h3>
  <pre>
    Water nymph, you have
    climbed from the shallows to don
    your dragon-colors.
    Perched on a reed stem
    all night, shedding your skin, you dry
    your wings in moonlight.
     
    Night melts into day.
    Swift birds wait to snap you up.
    Fly, dragonfly! Fly!
  </pre>

  <h3 class="poem-title">Scorpio, or, The Scorpion</h3>
  <pre>
    Now as the farmer sits at his accounts
Reviewing fleeces neath deciduous beeches
And notes in red contented ink
Net profits of his quite impossible serenity;
As graded apples marketably beautiful
Into the bushel-baskets sink
And trussed hay to the tin roof reaches,
And where red tiles through darkening trees are reared
A whole year's work is sold in sacks of meal;
Now suddenly running
Drops like a sprig
Of oak in a gale on the neck
The little wriggler,
Vindictive-legged cunning,
Drops like a fleck
Of blood on a finger ring
Crooking in his sting.
  </pre>
